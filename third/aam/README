===================
System Requirements
===================

AAMLibrary is written to be platform independent. It has been tested on Windows XP.
AAMLibrary makes use of the OpenCV library version 1.0 that can be downloaded from:

                http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencv
 
In order to make it work, you must modify a bug in OpenCV and rebuild it:
	-- cvBoundingRect() doesn't work fine. 
	-- opencv/cv/src/cvshapedescr.cpp around line 1161 
	-- replace CV_32SC1 to CV_32SC2 and CV_32FC1 to CV_32FC2.

================
A Quick Tutorial
================

To get familiared quickly with the library, execute the following steps:

1. Train the Cootes's basic active appearance models:
   > AAMBuilding 0 face_dir jpg pts model1

2. Train the Matthews and S. Baker's Inverse Compositional models:
   > AAMBuilding 1 face_dir jpg pts model2

3. Test fitting/Alignment:
   > AAMFitting model test.jpg

Notice: to make the program run faster, you are suggested to work in the release version.
